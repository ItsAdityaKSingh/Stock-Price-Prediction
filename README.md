# Stock-Price-Prediction
It is my final year project which is focussing on predicting the next 12 months of a listed stock.

This Project is implemented by using the ARIMA model with seasonal properties.
And Flask application is app.py which is used for rendering the ML model into the HTML page and draw a chart.
A chart is implemented using the javascript called as "Chart.js" which have different properties to repesent the data.

To install do the following:
1. clone this repository
2. mae a virtual environment (important step) for this, check on internet.
3. move to flask application page which is app.py.
4. then then that python file you will get a local host http.
5. open it in browser and enter the ticker symbol of a listed stock.
6. And if any error occurred then you can contact me.
7. ##IMPORTANT KEY POINTS##
8. There is new thing I found is that yahoo finance api randomly stop responding, because I faced that too then I look over StackOverflow where it states that it happens because yahoo limit the person accessibility.
9. For that I use manually datasets and I suggest you to find other api or use manuall datasets.
10. I am uploading that file with name model_1.py where code is work when you have saome maual dataset downloaded in your system i.e., csv files.
