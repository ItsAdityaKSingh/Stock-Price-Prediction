# Stock-Price-Prediction
It is my final year project which is focussing on predicting the next 12 months of a listed stock.

This Project is implemented by using the ARIMA model with seasonal properties.
And Flask application is app.py which is used for rendering the ML model into the HTML page and draw a chart.
A chart is implemented using the javascript called as "Chart.js" which have different properties to repesent the data.
